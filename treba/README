This is treba, v.0.1.

Treba is a basic command-line tool for training, decoding, and calculating with weighted (probabilistic) finite state automata (PFSA). It

* trains PFSA, decodes, calculates sequence probabilities and generates sequences of PFSA.
* includes a parallel implementation of PFSA training with Baum-Welch (optionally with deterministic annealing) for multiple CPUs/cores.
* uses a simple text format compatible with AT&T finite-state tools or OpenFST.

== INSTALLING ==
