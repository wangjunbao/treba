This is treba, v.1.01.

Treba is a basic command-line tool for training, decoding, and calculating with weighted (probabilistic) finite state automata (PFSA) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It

* trains PFSA/HMMs, decodes, calculates sequence probabilities and generates sequences from them.
* includes a parallel implementation of HMM/PFSA training with Baum-Welch (optionally with deterministic annealing) for multiple CPUs/cores.
* includes a Gibbs sampler for inferring probabilities with HMMs/PFSA, which can also be run with NVIDIA GPUs (using CUDA)
* includes state-merging algorithms for inferring probabilistic deterministic finite state automata (ALERGIA/MDI and variants)
* uses a simple text format compatible with AT&T finite-state tools or OpenFST.
