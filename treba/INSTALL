Compiling/installing treba
-------------------------

A generic Makefile that has been used to compile the Linux, win32 (with MinGW), and Mac OSX versions is included.

To compile treba

  make; sudo make install

should work on most UNIX systems.  The default installation target /usr/local can be changed in the Makefile.

If you have the CUDA development files installed, you can build with

  make CUDA=1

to enable the --cuda flag.

Some pre-built binaries are available in the bin/ directory in the tarball releases.
